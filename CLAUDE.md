# CLAUDE.md

## Project Identity

Personal, institution-style BTC/USDT futures trading system. The system may
eventually place real trades. Treat all execution, risk, leverage, position
mode, exchange API, deployment, and key-management changes as high-risk.

## Current Scope (MVP)

- Exchange: BingX (first implementation, not a hardcoded assumption)
- Product: BTC/USDT USDT-M Perpetual Futures
- Direction: long and short
- Order types: limit and guarded market
- Timeframes: 15m base, 5m extension, 1h regime filter
- Single-user, VPS-oriented, not a SaaS

## Long-term Design Targets (shape the architecture now, not built now)

- Multi-exchange / multi-symbol / equities expansion **without refactoring**
  OMS, Risk Gateway, or Execution — achieved by keeping `ExchangeAdapter` an
  interface from the start. BingX is the first adapter, not a baked-in
  assumption.
- Target latency ~100-200ms round trip on a single non-colocated VPS. This
  is not HFT — achievable with the Java trading plane + WebSocket market
  data, no exotic messaging infra needed.
- Eventually fully unattended 24/7 operation. Requires real process
  supervision (restart recovery, health checks) first — not there yet.
- Eventually automatic parameter re-learning. Requires a scheduled
  retraining pipeline with validation gates before any auto-promotion — not
  there yet. Any live-affecting promotion still requires human approval
  (see LLM Usage Policy).

Non-goals regardless of the above: HFT/co-location/tick-level strategies,
multi-user SaaS, Kubernetes, Kafka/Aeron/Chronicle Queue.

## Architecture

```text
Python Research Plane
- data research, deterministic backtesting, strategy experiments
- feature engineering, ML training/evaluation, scheduled retraining (later)
- report generation, deployment candidate generation
- must not place live orders directly

Java Trading Plane
- OMS, Risk Gateway, Execution Service
- ExchangeAdapter interface (BingX is the first implementation)
- position reconciliation, kill switch, paper/live runtime
- all live orders must pass through the Java Risk Gateway
```

Java scope is intentionally narrow: OMS / Risk / Execution / Exchange
Adapter / Reconciliation / Kill Switch only. No Spring/Kafka/K8s/Aeron.
Start with Java 21 + Gradle + JUnit + Jackson + SLF4J only. Strategy
research, backtesting, ML, and reporting stay in Python.

A new venue or asset class means writing a new `ExchangeAdapter`
implementation, not modifying OMS/Risk/Execution. Shared schemas
(order-intent, risk-decision, etc.) should stay exchange- and
asset-class-agnostic where practical.

Reassess the Python/Java split if: solo-dev burden becomes excessive, a
Python prototype proves sufficient on its own, or Python/Java schema drift
keeps recurring.

## Non-negotiable Rules

- Never enable live trading without explicit human approval.
- Never hardcode API keys, secrets, passwords, tokens, or private keys.
- Never modify `.env` or real credential files.
- Never weaken risk limits or increase leverage limits without explicit
  human approval.
- Never bypass the Java Risk Gateway.
- Never let Python place live orders directly.
- Never add live exchange write-access in CI.
- Never commit raw trading logs containing secrets or account identifiers.
- Never run untrusted install scripts (`curl | sh`, `wget | bash`).

## Risk Parameters (defaults — changing these needs explicit human approval)

**Canary live**: base leverage 1x, max 2x, max order notional 2%, daily
loss limit -0.5%, weekly -1.5%, monthly -3%, hard stop -4%.

**Stable live**: base leverage 2x, max 3x, max order notional 5%, daily
loss limit -1%, weekly -3%, monthly -6%, hard stop -8%, emergency stop
-10%.

## Paper Trading Pass Criteria

Minimum 30 days (45 recommended), 50+ trades, zero critical crashes, zero
duplicate orders, zero position mismatches, zero risk-gateway bypasses, no
missing daily reports, kill switch verified working, paper score 80+.

## Live Entry Criteria

Paper trading passed + paper score 80+ + all hard gates passed + VPS
operation + IP-restricted API key + no withdrawal permission + manually
approved live flag + leverage hard max 2x + market-order guard enabled +
kill switch verified.

## Exchange API Facts — BingX (first adapter, verify before relying on them)

- Symbol: `BTC-USDT`
- Recent trades: `GET /openApi/swap/v2/quote/trades`
- 15m klines: `GET /openApi/swap/v3/quote/klines`, interval token `15m`
- Historical range: `startTime`/`endTime` are half-open
  (`startTime <= t < endTime`), must align to the 900,000ms (15m) grid, max
  span 1000 candles per request
- `limit` is not a reliable count guarantee — requests over 1000 are
  silently capped; verify actual returned count in code
- Only public, unauthenticated read endpoints have been verified. Private /
  account / order endpoints are unverified.

## LLM Usage Policy

Allowed: coding assistance, research support, backtest interpretation, log
summarization, risk review, documentation.

Not allowed: acting as the live trading decision maker. LLM-suggested
signals, risk changes, or order logic must go through backtest/paper
verification and human approval like any other change. This includes
future auto-retraining: a model retraining automatically is fine, that
model being auto-promoted to paper/live without human approval is not.

## Development Methodology

Use the GSD phase loop for anything beyond a trivial change: **Discuss →
Plan → Execute → Verify → Ship**. `Discuss` resolves ambiguity before any
code is written — for R3-risk components (OMS, Risk Gateway, Execution)
this step must not be skipped. `Execute` uses fresh-context subagents per
task so a multi-month, multi-exchange project doesn't degrade into the
context rot that broke the previous attempt at this project. `Verify` must
include actual test runs, not a claim that tests would pass.

TDD discipline (red-green-refactor: failing test → minimum code to pass →
refactor) is required for OMS, Risk Gateway, and Execution code — not
optional. This rule is adopted directly, without installing a separate
framework for it.

Anthropic's official Agent Teams feature is available but not enabled by
default — GSD's own subagent-per-task orchestration already covers this
project's parallel-execution needs. Turn Agent Teams on only if a concrete
need appears that GSD's model doesn't cover.

## Tooling Stack

| Layer | Choice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CLI foundation | ripgrep, gh, uv | as needed |
| Guardrails (hooks) | `dwarvesf/claude-guardrails` (Lite) + a project-specific hook blocking live-flag activation and exchange live-order endpoints | add when `.env`/credentials first appear |
| Methodology | GSD (`.planning/` artifacts) + TDD rule above | active now |
| MCP | Context7, GitHub MCP | add when useful, not urgent |
| CI/CD | `claude-code-action` | add once PR volume justifies automation |
| Code review | CodeRabbit Pro (see below) | active now |
| Multi-agent orchestration | Anthropic Agent Teams (official) | standby, off by default |

## Code Review Gate

CodeRabbit Pro reviews every PR — see `.coderabbit.yaml` for the actual
rules (no live-trading enablement, no secrets, no risk/leverage relaxation,
Python cannot place live orders, Risk Gateway cannot be bypassed).

CodeRabbit Pro's Autofix is fine to accept for lint, formatting, docs, and
low-risk Python research code. For Java OMS / Risk Gateway / Execution,
anything touching credentials, or anything live-trading-related: review and
apply the fix manually. Do not accept an automated fix on high-risk code
without reading it.

## Branch and Merge

- Never commit or push directly to `main`.
- Changes go through a branch and a PR.
- Self-review and verify before opening a PR.
- CodeRabbit review must complete (not pending) before merge.

## Implementation Priority

1. Shared schemas (exchange/asset-class-agnostic where practical)
2. Java OMS state machine skeleton
3. Java Risk Gateway skeleton
4. Python deterministic backtest skeleton
5. Schema compatibility tests
6. Paper broker
7. `ExchangeAdapter` skeleton (BingX as first implementation)
8. Paper trading loop + 24/7 runtime supervision (restart recovery, health
   checks) — promoted priority, needed for the unattended-operation target
9. Auto-retraining pipeline (scheduled retrain, validation, promotion gate)
   — promoted priority, needed for the auto-learning target; promotion to
   paper/live still requires human approval
10. Canary live preparation

## Why this is more than a bare CLAUDE.md, but still not the old system

Guardrails, GSD, and CodeRabbit are here because concrete requirements
justify each one *now*: guardrails because real secrets will exist soon,
GSD because this project is genuinely multi-month and will span multiple
exchanges (context rot is a real risk here, not a hypothetical one),
CodeRabbit because it's already paid for and reviewing every PR is cheap.
Still deliberately excluded: a second full methodology framework running
alongside GSD, a multi-agent reviewer fleet, a multi-document
cross-referenced spec system, and Agent Teams until GSD's built-in
orchestration proves insufficient. A prior attempt at this project
accumulated 15 cross-referenced docs, a 5-level risk-classification system,
a 16-step PR lifecycle, and 5 reviewer subagents before a single
continuously-running paper trading loop existed — that process outpaced
the working system and became the bottleneck itself. Add anything beyond
this file only when a concrete, recurring problem justifies it.
